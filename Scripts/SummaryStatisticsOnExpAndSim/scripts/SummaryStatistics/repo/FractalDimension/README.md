Estimates the fractal dimension of an image using the Minkowski–Bouligand dimension. An image of the Sierpiński triangle is included for validation.

The Minkowski–Bouligand dimension, also called the box-counting dimension uses the ratio of number of boxes needed to cover the set as the box size decreases to compute the fractal dimension.
